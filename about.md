Greetings! My name's Quinn Daley (*pronouns: they/them*) and I'm a non-binary software developer living in Leeds.

Mostly my life online is lived on Twitter and Instagram. You can find my handles at the bottom of this page. Occasionally I might post something on this blog too.

If people have heard of me for some reason, they might have heard of me because of:

## Fish Percolator

I run [Fish Percolator](https://www.fishpercolator.co.uk/), a tiny software development house. My business's mission is to *"change the world in small ways through the application of technology"* and to that end we've helped numerous startups and spinoffs to get their technology off the ground.

If you have your own tech ideas, why not book in for a free consultation? Maybe we can help.

[Fish Percolator has its own blog](https://medium.com/@fishpercolator), which is probably more interesting than anything you'll find here.

## Yorkshire O.P.E.N

I'm the co-organizer of [Yorkshire O.P.E.N](https://www.y-open.org.uk/), the main discussion and support community for polyamorous and ethically non-monogamous people in Yorkshire.

It's been running since 2012 and I'm really proud of our little community and all that it has done.

We meet monthly in Leeds. [If you'd like to come along, check out our website for more info about what to expect](https://www.y-open.org.uk/).

## Leeds Tube

Years ago I created a fictional tube map of an alternate-universe Leeds where public transport has always been the priority. It has been quite the sensation, even today, having been covered by BBC Radio Leeds and Yorkshire Evening Post twice each.

As part of the launch of this site, [I made some 2019 changes to the map for a (hopefully interesting) first blog post]({% post_url 2019-04-30-leeds-tube-v4 %}).

## Leeds Beer Quest

Between 2012 and 2017, my partner Emily & I visited every single pub and bar in Leeds city centre, and rated them for the quality of their beers.

The [Leeds Beer Quest](http://leedsbeer.info/) site is still active, although of course it seems rather dated these days.

We tried to keep it going for a little while as new bars opened, but it started to get tedious as the majority were identikit bars with the same lip service paid to craft beer. Of course, there have been some gems opened since then and I like to think that privately we still keep on top of where to find the best beers in Leeds!

## My other interests

Does anyone read this part of people's about pages? These are the kinds of things you might find a blog post or two about on this site in the future.

* **Sewing**: I'm a self-taught machine sewist - still very much a beginner but I absolutely love it. You can follow my sewing adventures on Instagram.
* **Languages**: I love learning different languages; learning how they evolved and what makes them unique. I'm particularly interested in English (despite my Twitter handle, I'm a descriptive grammarian) and I speak a modicum of Italian and Esperanto. At the time of writing my Duolingo streak was over 2000 days... [you can follow me if you like](https://www.duolingo.com/pedantic_git)!
* **Politics**: I'm a very active member of the Green Party, currently serving as the coordinator of the Leeds Federation of Green Parties. Despite my party's name — and the extreme urgency of environmental issues — my main concerns are advancing human rights and the eventual demise of unsustainable free-market capitalism. I choose this party because it has the best record and policies on these things.
* **Political geography**: I'm fascinated by how the world is divided up, both into countries and the individual sub-governments within. The history of it, and how quickly it changes, its interaction with language & ethnicity, and so on and so on. I'm fascinated by facts regarding population, the names of places and flags. If I ever lose a whole afternoon procrastinating, chances are this is what I've been reading.
* **Beer**: There's never been a better time in history for beer. According to Untappd I have tried over 2500 different beers since 2012 and I've barely scratched the surface. It's such a wildly varied drink and I like all the styles, even the really sour ones. My favourite all-round beer in the world is *probably* Odell's Myrcenary. I have a bottle signed by Doug Odell.
* **Board games**: I don't mean Monopoly. I love complex-but-not-too-complex Euro-style boardgames, and Leeds is a great city for buying and playing them. My favourite is probably Brew Crafters (spotting a theme?)
* **Twin Peaks & Kate Bush**: I get easily sucked into the fandom surrounding some pop culture, and none moreso than Twin Peaks and Kate Bush. My business's name was inspired by both of them!
